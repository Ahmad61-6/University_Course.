- `<table>`: Creates a table structure, with a width of 500px set via inline CSS.
- `<tr>`: Defines a row in the table.
- `<th>`: Represents a header cell in a table, often displayed in bold or centered by default.
- `colspan="3"`: Makes the cell span across 3 columns in the table.
- `rowspan="3"`: Makes the cell span across 3 rows in the table.
- `<td>`: Defines a standard data cell in a table, which holds content within the rows and columns.

These elements create a table with styled borders, merged columns (`colspan`) and rows (`rowspan`), and a specified width.
